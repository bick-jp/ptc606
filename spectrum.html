      <h1>Activity: try it yourself</h1>
      <p>In this activity, let's try different grips to play low, middle, and high pitch sound using spectrum analyzer. Spectrum analyzer is a tool that you can visually see the pitch of the sound. The y-axis is volume and the x-axis is pitch (frequency in Hz), with lower tones on the left (220Hz) and higher tones on the right (2200Hz).</p>
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Allow microphone access if asked.</li>
        <li>Click "Play" button.</li>
        <li>Try different grips to play low, middle, and high pitch sound.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>You can see: (1) the peak in lower frequency (left side) for low pitch, (2) no peaks but flat for middle pitch, and (3) the peak in higer frequenvy (right side) for high pitch.</p>
